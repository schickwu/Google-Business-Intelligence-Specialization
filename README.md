## Capstone Project
### Overview
The Customer Growth team at Cyclistic is developing a plan to grow the business over the next
few years. The team wants to understand how customers use bikes in different situations and
gain key insights that may help shape business development strategies; their first priorities are
to identify customer needs at different station locations and to determine user differences in user
behavior between customers and subscribers. The team plans to gain key insights from the
dataset, as insights gained solely through internal employee observations can be biased and
not holistic. The dataset contains a large number of trip records, and the team decided to create
some dashboards and charts to display key insights derived from the dataset. The executive
view must include key data points that are summarized and aggregated so that the leadership
team has a clear understanding of how customers are using Cyclistic.

### Primary question: How can we draw promotion strategies for efficient customer growth and new
station growth from customer user behavior insights?
